<h2>Introduction</h2>
</header>
<p>I am Chris Babcock, the current moderator and developer of TBG.
I am only able to devote the time I have dedicated to the development 
of To Boldly Go because I live on disability income. While I love this 
work and would be willing to do it without compensation, I still have 
needs that disability income won't cover. Towards that end, I am 
approaching the player community with a simple request. It is my hope 
that each player will help according to his ability to contribute towards 
a fundraising goal of $10 USD per developer hour so that I can continue 
to focus on TBG development without distraction.</p>
<p>While I plan to run TBG free and ad free, it has been my experience
that people do tend to enjoy games more when they and the others with whom 
they play with understand the <em>value</em> of the service that they 
enjoy. As much as I need the money personally, the request for donations 
is as much for the players as it is for myself. The game needs to be 
free to play so that we can recruit players in numbers to make the game 
fun for all, but there must also be a means for players to understand 
the value of the game. If this game is worth a $1 USD per turn to you 
then $150 USD per year would be a fair price to pay, but I am only 
asking that each player please give as he is able.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, TBG players have contributed $150 
towards the 150 development hours spent on TBG since the public 
beta opened.</p>
