<h2>To Boldly Go</h2>
<p>To Boldly Go (TBG) is a space adventure game written by Jeremy Maiden, 
who is better known in some circles for his Diplomacy variants. The TBG 
interface was born out of his experience with play by mail games like 
Diplomacy and Olympia. It's an open-ended game, meaning that there's no 
victory condition; you play as long as you want to play.  You can quit at 
any time and it won't interrupt the game for the other players. Players 
can join at anytime and still be competitive. TBG is not a Diplomacy 
variant, but it is a good attempt at realizing some of the dynamics of 
Diplomacy in an open-ended game.</p>
<p>
TBG is a turn based strategy game where turns are adjudicated simultaneously, 
like Diplomacy. You submit orders via a web form. Turns run Monday, Wednesday, 
and Friday at 11pm UTC. (Since people all over the world play TBG, the server 
does not observe daylight savings time.) The default orders are mostly sane, 
so you can miss an occasional turn without ruining your position. For extended 
absences, there is a holiday mechanism.</p>
<p>
The new TBG game is moderated by Chris Babcock, judge keeper of USAK Diplomacy 
judge, who maintains the high standard of service for TBG that he does for USAK.

<h2>About ASCII King Games</h2>

<p>ASCII stand for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It's 
the ancestor of ISO-8859, which defines text codes for English and other 
western european languages today. ASCII King is a bad pun. When you pronounce 
it in a sloppy manner, it sounds like an expression that used to mean 
&quot;really fun...&quot; although it's purportedly less fun to be on the 
receiving end.</p>

<p>ASCII King Games provides support services for text-based social games, 
i.e. any multiplayer interactive strategy or roleplaying game where distance 
play is realized in a text protocol and play is enhanced by communication 
with the other players. Services include Internet infrastructure for gaming 
communities and tools to support software development in those communities. 
Additional services may be provided as competency is available. Games within 
the scope of ASCII King Games include board games, card games, pen and paper 
RPGs and other game formats whose primary mode of play may or may not 
necessarily be on-line, but where on-line play could feasibly be conducted 
without resource-intensive graphics. These services include on-line support 
of off-line communities.</p>

<p>Chris Babcock, the founder of ASCII King Games, chose text-based social 
games because of his belief in the role of play in continuing education. It 
is his conviction that games which stimulate the language centers in the 
brain are more likely to be conducive to learning higher thinking skills 
and social reasoning and less likely to be commercially supported than games 
that promote violence and lethargy. He believes in the potential of the 
Internet to provide enhanced social interaction and thinks it should be 
obvious that text based applications provide a better entertainment value 
for the storage and bandwidth costs than streaming video.</p>
