<h1>To Boldly Go: Rules
</h1>
<p>
(Version 22, 27 Jan 2014)</p>
<h2><a name="The_Board"></a>The Board</h2>
<p>
Players move their <a href="#Star_Ships">star ships</a> on a board
that represents a flattened
star cluster containing 50 x 50 squares, amongst which are many
detectable stars. Star ships jump from star to star without entering
any
of the squares without stars, which seem to contain nothing of
interest. Each star has some <a href="#Locations">locations</a> (areas
of significance to the
game), which can be on planets or in space. All locations at the same
star system are considered close enough that a ship at the star can use
any of its locations in a single turn. There's no need to move within a
starsystem. Half the stars have habitable planets, which can contain
any type of location. These stars have names such as Arcturus. The
other stars have no habitable planets and contain only locations of the
types not associated with populations, e.g. asteroid belts. These stars
have numbers instead of names.</p>

<h2><a name="How_can_I_tell_whether_Im_rich"></a>Energy</h2>

<p>
Energy functions as money (symbolised by $), used to define the prices
of all other items in trading. It's also used to move 
<a href="http://tbg.asciiking.com/Rules.html#Star_Ships">star ships</a>.
Getting more energy is a basic step towards achieving many other goals,
since it can be used to buy several other forms of success. But note
that there are still some significant routes to success that can't be
bought.</p>
<p>
Each star ship has a power plant that provides $50 each turn. Working
<a href="Rules.html#Modules">modules</a> consume energy each turn. To 
avoid paying these costs it's
possible to "shut down" modules. Turning them back on requires a repair
action.</p>

<h2>
<a name="Locations"></a>Locations</h2>
<p>
Each location is in a specific star system and has a type (e.g.
academy, asteroid belt etc.). It may also have features that
distinguish it from other locations of the same type (e.g. a colony
will offer its own price for goods it buys, and a school will teach
only one sort of skill). Some locations also contain a criminal, though
they will not be visible without some police work.</p>
<p>The number of each type of location in the game is:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="#Academies_and_Schools">Academy</a> 4</li>
<li> <a href="#Arsenals">Arsenal</a> 32</li>
<li><a href="#Asteroid_Belts">Asteroid Belt</a> 32</li>
<li> <a href="#Badlands">Badland</a> 32</li>
<li> <a href="#Colonies">Colony</a> 256</li>
<li><a href="#Comet_Clouds">Comet Cloud</a> 64</li>
<li> <a href="#Stellar_Coronas">Coronasphere</a> 96</li>
<li><a href="#Near_Space_and_Deep_Space">Deep Space</a> 96</li>
<li> <a href="#Factories">Factory</a> 32</li>
<li><a href="#Gas_Giants">Gas Giants</a> 96</li>
<li><a href="#Hiring_Halls">Hiring Hall</a> 32</li>
<li> <a href="#Homeworlds">Homeworld</a> 32</li>
<li> <a href="#Minefields">Minefields</a> 32</li>
<li><a href="#Near_Space_and_Deep_Space">Near Space</a> 96</li>
<li> <a href="#Oceans">Ocean</a> 32</li>
<li> <a href="#Prisons">Prison</a> 16</li>
<li> <a href="#Academies_and_Schools">School</a> 64</li>
<li> <a href="#Stargates">Stargate</a> 128</li>
<li><a href="#Starnet_Terminals">Starnet Terminal</a> 32</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="Homeworlds"></a>Homeworlds</h2>
<p>
These can be used as direct sources of income by <a
href="#Annoying_Aliens">demanding money with
menaces</a> (but only by the most powerful ship in their starsystem),
and to earn credit with the
<a href="#Great_Old_Ones">medical god</a> by <a href="#Helping_Aliens">fighting
plague</a>. They're often also worth visiting
because they contain <a href="#Shops">shops</a> and <a
href="#Academies_and_Schools">schools</a> for all skills. They have 6
<a href="#Votes">votes</a> each in the <a href="#The_Galactic_Council">Galactic
Council</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Academies_and_Schools"></a>Academies and Schools</h2>
<p>
These are used as sources of training for officers, which demands money
and, for advanced academy training, varying levels of pre-existing
skill. (Normally the number and skill of crew under an officer supply
an increase in the officer's <a href="#Skills">effective skill</a>,
but for academy entry
only the officer's personal skill applies).</p>
<h2><a name="Asteroid_Belts"></a>Asteroid Belts</h2>
<p>
These allow ore to be found for immediate cash sale. The amounts that
can be collected depend on <a href="#Modules">impulse drives</a> and
engineering skill, up to
a limit for the whole star system's mining per turn.<br>
</p>
<h2>
<a name="Shops"></a>Shops</h2>
<p>
These sell ship <a href="#Modules">modules</a> for <a
href="#How_can_I_tell_whether_Im_rich">energy</a> (i.e. money). They
are displayed on
reports in the format of ships, but are not ships for interaction and
combat purposes, and don't move. They gradually restock with new
modules chosen by the <a href="#Ministers">Minister of Industry</a> as
they sell out.</p>
<h2><a name="Hiring_Halls"></a>Hiring Halls</h2>
<p>
These are used to recruit new <a href="#Crew">crew</a>. Each officer
may recruit crew to a
limit of their personal skill level, and may train those crew up to an
average of no more than that level. Crew provide an increase in the
officer's effective skill for most purposes of the square root of their
total skill, i.e at most they can double the officer's personal skill
level.</p>
<h2><a name="Arsenals"></a>Arsenals</h2>
<p>
These sell photon torpedoes. Torpedoes are different from all other
weapons in that they are not re-usable and they have no mass. They
allow rich
players to gain a significant but extremely expensive <a href="#Combat">combat</a>
advantage.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Prisons"></a>Prisons</h2>
<p>
These are used to accept captured <a href="#Criminals">criminals</a>
from players and to pay
energy rewards for them.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Factories"></a>Factories</h2>
<p>
There's one of these for each type of trade good, selling them to
players for energy. Goods can only be bought if the player's ship has
cargo pods to store them, and each pod can contain only one type of
good (though larger pods can contain multiple goods of the same type).
Goods are not directly usable by players and are bought with a view to
selling them at a profit somewhere else. The most valuble goods, marked
with (!) in their names, are <a href="#Contraband">contraband</a> and
may not be sold without
risk of <a href="#Annoying_Aliens">annoying</a> <a href="#Aliens">alien</a>
governments. All factories also buy the special
trade good "<a href="#Scrap">Scrap</a>" for $25 per unit.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Colonies"></a>Colonies</h2>
<p>For each type of trade good, there are eight colonies that buy trade
goods from players for energy. Prices fall as goods are
supplied, but rise elsewhere. Goods range widely in basic price. Low
profit goods are common, but there are a few very profitable
types as well. The most profitable are <a href="#Contraband">contraband</a>.
<br>
</p>
<p>Each colony has one
<a href="#Votes">vote</a> in the <a href="#The_Galactic_Council">Galactic
Council</a>.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Starnet_Terminals"></a>
<a name="Terminals"></a>
Starnet Terminals
</h2>
<p>
There are 32 Terminals. They are used to access ancient computers for
information guessing <a href="#Passwords">passwords</a>. Each starnet
successfully accessed provides the player with <a href="#Favour">favour</a>
from the Wise One
each turn, until their access is <a href="#Spells">purged</a> by
another player.</p>
<h2>
<a name="Stargates"></a>Stargates</h2>
<p>Stargates are shortcuts to other star
systems. They are normally unusable without special <a
href="#Artifacts">artifacts</a>
associated with the Great Old Ones. Each gate has a key number from 0
to 7, meaning it can be used (in either direction) by a ship carrying a
key of that number or by casting a suitable <a href="#Spells">spell</a>.
Movement through a
gate costs no energy, unlike conventional movement.</p>
<h2><a name="Near_Space_and_Deep_Space"></a>Near Space and Deep Space</h2>
<p>
Most star systems have areas of space which may contain things of
interest, usually <a href="#Popcorn">popcorn</a> sources.</p>
<h2><a name="Comet_Clouds"></a>Comet Clouds</h2>
<p>
Many stars have an associated cloud of comets beyond their planets,
each can supply one unit of Chocolate to the first ship that tries to
harvest it each turn.</p>
<h2><a name="Oceans"></a>Oceans</h2>
<p>
Common on habitable planets, these are the source of rare <a
href="#Medicine">medicines</a>. </p>
<h2><a name="Dangerous_Locations"></a>Dangerous Locations</h2>
<p>
The following location types can only be entered for resource
collecting by suitably equipped star ships. Each needs a specific type
of module to represent a minimum proportion of the ship (known as the
"<a href="#Factors">factor</a>"), weighted by tech level and officer
skill. The percentage
required is shown in the location report, and the percentage a ship
actually has is shown in the ship report. For example, a ship with 10
modules including 2 "primitive" (tech level 1) impulse drives would
have an impulse drive factor of 20%, and would be able to enter gas
giants with requirements of 20% or less. Replacing the drives with new
ones of "basic" type (tech level 2) would raise the ship's impulse
factor to 40%.</p>
<p>
These locations may also be entered for combat purposes, either to hide
from an attacking enemy or to hunt down a fleeing target. Willingness
to enter them is set on the Hide/Hunt menu, and requires that all
officers use the Stand By order, i.e. do nothing else for the whole
turn. Hiding or Hunting in a dangerous location risks damage to every
module of the ship with a chance equal to the danger level of the
location minus the ship's factor in the relevant module. The decision
to hunt in a location implies willingness to hunt in other locations of
the same or lesser danger, which the prey might hide in.</p>
<h3><a name="Badlands"></a>Badlands</h3>
<p>
These hostile environments need good life
support for safe operations. They sometimes contain alien outlaws
(rogues) who can be recruited as crew. Rogues are better than raw
recruits because they usually have some skill already and because they
occur in
larger numbers. The drawback is that their <a href="#Aliens">government</a>
declares the
recruiting player an enemy.</p>
<h3><a name="Gas_Giants"></a>Gas Giants</h3>
<p>
Most star systems have gas giants. These can be entered only by ships
with
powerful impulse drives to resist the extremes of gravity and pressure.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Minefields"></a>Minefields</h3>
<p>These areas of space are extremely
dangerous to ships without good enough cloaks to avoid attracting
mines. They are a source of "free" photon torpedoes. Each weaponry crew
can find up to five. Odds of finding torpedos are related to the
minefield's danger
level. Minefields cause a reduction in health sometimes avoided by good
life
support.</p>
<h3><a name="Stellar_Coronas"></a>Stellar Coronas</h3>
<p>
Most stars have navigable outer spheres, used to gather free energy at
the risk of damage from unexpected flares. They require strong shields
for a ship to survive.</p>
<h2><a name="Officers"></a>Officers</h2>
<p>
Players control their star ship via its four officers (plus some minor
trading and exploring commands which do not need the officers' full
attention). Officers can be developed by training and experience, and
cannot be gained or lost. Highly skilled officers are essential for
operating and maintaining a powerful star ship.
</p>
<p>Officers have a specific skill (e.g. Engineering), a level of
expertise
in that skill, and may have <a href="#Crew">crew</a> under their
command. An officer's
skill will increase as they use it to solve problems and when they
obtain specialised training in it.</p>
<p>
Each officer may be given one standard major order per turn, such as
having an adventure or attending an academy. Each officer may also
execute one very special action, known as a <a href="#Spells">spell</a>,
if they have
sufficient <a href="#Favour">favour</a> with the appropriate <a
href="#Great_Old_Ones">god</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Crew"></a>Crew</h2>
<p>
Crew are much less detailed, treated more as possessions of their
<a href="#Officers">officers</a> than as individuals. The set of crew
under each officer has a
pool of skill, increased when the officer devotes a turn to training
them, and decreased when crew die.</p>
<p>
Basic unskilled crew can be recruited from <a href="#Hiring_Halls">hiring
halls</a>, and use of an
appropriate <a href="#Spells">spell</a> allows recruiting of skilled
crew from halls. Outlaw
bands (rogues) with higher skill may be recruited, usually from
<a href="#Badlands">badlands</a>, at the cost of becoming an enemy of
their <a href="#Aliens">government</a>. <br>
</p>
<p>
The ship's crew as a whole have health, a single number which is the
percentage chance of each one surviving the turn. Health decreases
randomly each turn for
general wear and tear and may decrease a lot during combat or
adventures. Health is also
reduced by carrying popcorn on the ship. Health
increases a small amount for the quality of life support modules the
ship has and as a result of the
medical officer devoting a turn to healing the crew. Health concerns do
not affect <a href="#Officers">officers</a>, who live forever.</p>
<h2><a name="Skills"></a>Skills</h2>
<p>
Skill levels range from 0 to 32. There are 32 things (adventures,
training possibilities etc.) that provide a level each. There is no
benefit to a particular character having the same adventure or training
more than once. They either have it or they don't. Note that the levels
are not ordered, i.e. achieving any 10 of the things produces a skill
level of 10. Once gained, skills can only be lost to attacks from Evil
<a href="#Magic_Rings">Ring</a> holders.</p>
<p>The 32 skill levels are made up of the following types:</p>
<ul>
<li>16 Types of <a href="#Adventures">adventure</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>2 Types of <a href="#Reliability_and_Usability">repairing</a>
ship <a href="#Modules">modules</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>2 Types of <a href="#Reliability_and_Usability">maintaining</a>
ship <a href="#Modules">modules</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>8 Levels of advanced training at the appropriate <a
href="#Academies_and_Schools">academy</a> (expensive and
the officer needs a qualifying level of personal skill already: 0, 4,
8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28)&nbsp;</li>
<li>2 Levels of basic training at appropriate <a
href="#Academies_and_Schools">schools</a> (cheap and no minimum
qualification level)&nbsp;</li>
<li>1 "Enlightenment" type, gained by casting the <a href="#Spells">spell</a>
of the same name.&nbsp;</li>
<li>1 Starnet Hacking type, gained by using the correct <a
href="#Passwords">password</a> at a
Starnet Terminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Skills and main examples of use are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Science is used to gain information, associated modules are
sensors and
cloaks.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Engineering is used for movement, associated modules are warp
drives and
impulse drives.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Weaponry is used both for ship-to-ship and creature-to-creature
fighting,
associated modules are weapons and shields.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Medical is used to heal and maintain crew, associated modules are
sickbays and life support.</li>
</ul>
<p>
An officer also has a role in leading landing parties for <a
href="#Adventures">adventures</a> in
their own skill, and supporting landing parties attempting adventures
in other skills.</p>
<p>
For most purposes the effective skill of an officer is their personal
skill plus the crew's contribution, which is the square root of their
total skill. The effect of
this and other training constraints is that an officer can at most
double their own skill by acquiring as many crew as possible and
training them as fully as possible.</p>
<h2><a name="Star_Ships"></a>Star Ships</h2>
<p>
A star ship is a collection of <a href="#Modules">modules</a> of
various types, e.g. warp
drive, weapons, cargo pods. Each player has one ship, any modules they
control form part of that ship, and their people are the officers and
crew of that ship. If a player loses her ship completely, she is
normally eliminated and may <a href="#What_if_it_all_goes_wrong">restart</a>
with the basic set-up as if she is a new player. Optionally, players
may choose to continue
without a ship.</p>
<p>
The modules in a player's first star ship are special "demo"
components, which decay over time until becoming useless. Demo modules
cannot
be <a href="#Reliability_and_Usability">maintained</a> or sold to <a
href="#Shops">shops</a>. They lose 1% reliability per turn. Players
will use
this first ship as a stepping stone, acquiring the modules to form
their real ship before the demo expires. If not, they can always
restart with a new demo ship and try again. <br>
</p>
<p>Pods are a special case,
and do not have reliability, repairs or maintenance. Standard pods
always work, but "demo" pods are destroyed on being unloaded with a
chance in percent equal to the value of all the non-demo modules in
their ship, valued by their tech levels.</p>
<h2><a name="Modules"></a>Modules</h2>
<p>
Star ship modules, skills needed to repair and maintain them, and
places
they allow entry to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warp Drive is used to move between star systems (Engineering). </li>
<li>Impulse Drive is used in asteroid mining and to change range in
combat
(Engineering) and to enter <a href="#Gas_Giants">gas giants</a>.</li>
<li>Sensors are used to detect hidden adventure possibilities and to
overcome
hostile cloaking (Science). </li>
<li>Cloaking is used to thwart hostile sensors, mainly to open fire
at
shorter range (Science) and is used to enter <a href="#Minefields">minefields</a>.</li>
<li>Life Support maintains or even improves crew health without
special
actions (Medical) and is used to enter <a href="#Badlands">badlands</a>.
</li>
<li>Sick Bay improves crew health, fights planetary plagues or
researches
new <a href="#Medicine">medicines</a>, as special actions (Medical).</li>
<li>Shields are used in defence (Weaponry) and to enter <a
href="#Stellar_Coronas">coronas</a> and the <a href="#Popcorn">popcorn</a>
source. </li>
<li>Weapons (various types) are used to attack other ships (Weaponry).</li>
<li>Cargo Pods are used to carry <a href="#Trade_Goods">trade goods</a>
or <a href="#Mercenaries">mercenaries</a> (none). <a href="#Artifacts">Artifacts</a>
are unique items with varying uses and properties (<a
href="#Great_Old_Ones">Great One</a>
Favour)</li>
</ul>
<p>
A module has a tech level rating that reflects how well it performs, on
a scale of: Primitive (1), Basic (2), Mediocre (3), Advanced (4),
Exotic (5), Magic (6). In most cases a level X module is X times as
useful as a level 1 module (players start with only Primitive level 1
modules). But a weak or low-tech ship can still attempt most actions
with some chance of success or at high cost, e.g. a ship with small or
low-tech jump drives can still make large jumps, they merely cost an
excessive amount of energy. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>
<a name="Factors"></a>Factors</h2>
<p>
The effectiveness of modules for many purposes depends on the
percentage of the ship
they make up, weighted up for tech level and with a bonus for the skill
level of the associated officer and crew up to a maximum of tripling
the module percentage. A ship's factor for one item
can be increased by removing other items and carrying around
modules that are always breaking or much lower tech than the rest of
the ship is usually wrong.</p>
<p>
The game includes many modules, with a random assortment of efficiency,
reliability and energy cost. Initially they are scattered around the
board in various place such as <a href="#Shops">shops</a>,
adventures, and other ships.<br>
</p>
<p>
As a special case to prevent otherwise viable players becoming stranded
by accidental loss of their only engines, a primitive demo warp drive
may be bought anywhere for $500. This is a last resort deal not offered
to players who don't need it, in case they are unwise enough to accept
it. &nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Reliability_and_Usability"></a>Reliability and Usability</h2>
<p>
Confusion must be avoided between these similar but distinct properties
of modules.</p>
<p>
A module has a reliability factor of 1-99%, being the chance it will
work each turn without going wrong and becoming unusable. Becoming
unusable reduces reliability by 1%, but more significantly prevents the
module being used again until it has been repaired. If reliability
falls below 1% the module is destroyed. An unusable module can be
repaired using the repair order, with a chance of success equal to the
item's reliability factor plus the skill level of the character making
repairs.</p>
<p>
Reliability can be increased by successful use of the maintenance
order, maintaining an item improves reliability by the skill level of
the character doing the maintenance, less the square of its tech level
(i.e. low skilled characters can't maintain high tech items at all).
Note that even an unusable module can be maintained, it doesn't have to
be repaired first.</p>
<p>
For example, an old and battle-damaged but patched up module can be
reliability 20% and usable, meaning that it will function but will
probably break down at once. Or a new and well-maintained module with a
minor blown fuse can be 99% reliable but unusable.</p>
<p>
Some kinds of maintenance are easier to do than other kinds. For
badly damaged modules, there's an additional option, Priority
Maintenance. When an officer elects to perform priority maintenance
their crew can work on several modules at once. The maximum number of
modules that can maintained at a time this way is one quarter of the
officer's skill. When an officer performs this action, he
automatically maintains the lowest reliability modules up to the number
allowed by their skill level. Each is maintained just as it would be
if the officer had maintained it individually, but cannot have its
reliability increased beyond the officer's skill level.</p>
<h2><a name="Scrap"></a>Scrap</h2>
<p>
Scrap is a special type of <a href="#Trade_Goods">trade good</a> that
can be made by players as
well as produced by the scrap factory and traded in the normal way.
Players make scrap using the Scrap Menu to select modules and/or trade
goods. These are converted to scrap trade goods and put in the
player's cargo pods, ready for sale. Demo
modules cannot be converted to scrap.</p>
<h2><a name="Artifacts"></a>Artifacts</h2>
<p>
Each artifact has an individual name and its own set of properties,
mainly from the sets below. They may also have unique and initially
unknown features. Artifacts have no mass for purposes of diluting other
aspects of a ship, so adding an artifact to a ship won't increase its
movement costs.</p>
<p>
Blessings: Each blessing gives a 50% bonus to the effects of one type
of item. An artifact that blesses Impulse Drives has the same
effect as increasing all the ship's Impulse Drives' tech level by 50%.
Owning an artifact costs five favour per turn from the <a
href="#Great_Old_Ones">Great Old One</a>
concerned with the items it blesses. If the owner can't pay this
favour, the artifact breaks.</p>
<p>
Curses: Each curse causes a 50% reduction in the effects of one type of
item. An artifact that curses Warp Drives has the same effect as
halving all the ship's Warp Drives' tech levels. Curses can be removed
with a suitable <a href="#Spells">spell</a>. An artifact is given an
extra
curse whenever it changes hands.</p>
<p>
Keys: Each key allows the use of any <a href="#Stargates">stargate</a>
with the matching lock. There are 8 keys and 8 locks.</p>
<p>
Note that although a single artifact won't bless and curse the same
items, a ship with multiple artifacts may have multiple blesses and
curses on the same items. Duplicates produce no additional benefit or
penalty, and the combination of bless and curse leads to a penalty down
to 75% efficiency.</p>
<p>
Artifact cursing and blessing is the same process as spell cursing and
blessing so there is no additional benefit to using both an artifact
and a <a href="#Spells">spell</a> to bless the same type of item. </p>
<h2><a name="Magic_Rings"></a>Magic Rings</h2>
<p>
There are 8 magic rings: 4 good and 4 evil, one associated with each
<a href="#Skills">skill</a> type. Rings start in
random locations and are reported when discovered by normal
<a href="#Exploration">exploration</a>. Evil rings can be picked up
freely, good rings can be
collected using an expensive <a href="#Spells">spell</a>.</p>
<p>
Holding rings brings benefits and penalties. In combat with other
players, the officers holding evil rings gain all the skills of their
counterpart that they don't already have; the victim loses these
skills. Ships with evil rings must move (at no cost) to the star where
the most other ships are at the end of each turn. Evil rings provide an
extra <a href="#Crew">crew</a> recruit every turn up the officer's
command limit.</p>
<p>
Good rings' cost is that the wearer gives 10 favour to each other
player at the same star at the end of the turn. The benefit is that
they mutually annihilate with evil rings of the same skill-type, before
the evil ring can steal any skills. Destroyed rings are recycled as new
exploration finds. </p>
<h2><a name="Mercenaries"></a>Mercenaries</h2>
<p>
There are 64 units of mercenaries, ground troops willing to fight for
pay but in need of transport to battlefields at other stars and
expecting to be paid even when there's no work for them to do. Each
mercenary unit is one of eight types with varying strengths in
different types of battle: doubled in their best terrain and halved in
their worst terrain. They are carried in standard cargo pods, they fit
into any size pod but cannot share it with other units or regular cargo.</p>
<p>
Each turn one unit is auctioned, in terms of rate of pay in energy per
turn. The unit joins the winning ship after the movement phase.
Depending on employment levels, units already
employed will demand pay rises to stay in service. These are awarded
automatically as needed. Units cannot have their pay reduced, but can
be demobilised at any time. Demobilising a mercenary unit makes a
player unpopular with
mercenaries, and they can hire no more until forgiven. Forgiveness may
occur with a 5% chance each turn.</p>
<p>
The only use of mercenary units is to fulfill contracts, of which there
is one per turn, at a random star and with a random terrain type, with
a fee relating to how many contracts were fulfilled lately. Contracts
are resolved after movement, so it's possible to get to them in time by
jumping at once. Contracts are won by the strongest mercenary force in
the right place, allowing for the terrain effects on their units. There
are no losses in fulfilling contracts. Mercenaries wouldn't fight if
it was that dangerous. Ties in bidding for new units and in combat
strength at a contract site
are resolved using total weaponry skill.

<h2><a name="Medicine"></a>Medicine</h2>
<p>
Medicine can be collected from <a href="#Oceans">oceans</a>, with a
chance of success equal
to the player's sickbay <a href="#Factors">percentage</a>. Success
provides a type of medicine
which can be sold to a specific alien race's <a href="#Homeworlds">homeworld</a>
for a specific
price usually around $2500, related to sickbay percentage: sale is
automatic when the player enters the right star system.</p>
<p>
A player may carry only one type of medicine at a time, finding a new
one causes any old one to be discarded. Selling the medicine also
removes it. It cannot be sold again. </p>
<h2><a name="Aliens"></a>Aliens</h2>
<p>Each homeworld, colony and non-player ship is associated with an
alien
race. This race has an attitude towards each player - enemy or not.
Enemy
means that their ships will attack the player whenever they have the
chance. Each alien race has a basic mood of friendly,
neutral, hostile or chaotic. These control how its attitude to each
player is decided. Friendly races forgive attacks on their people (e.g.
Ettercaps), or lack an integrated state and don't care about them (e.g.
Centaurs). Neutral races are friendly at first but become permanent
enemies
when attacked (e.g. Djinni).</p>
<p>Hostile races always demand a gift from ships they meet, and will
attack if it's not given. Chaotic aliens may be randomly friendly or
hostile at each meeting, regardless of what's happened before. They
demand a gift sometimes and will sometimes attack if it's not given,
but
other times will be bluffing and not attack. Aliens demand as gift the
pod containing the least valuble <a href="#Trade_Goods">trade good</a>
other than scrap, or a
random module if the player doesn't have any non-scrap trade goods.</p>
<p>
Aliens who attack will sometimes hunt in <a href="#Dangerous_Locations">dangerous
locations</a>. If at
their homeworld, they will self-destruct as close to the player's
ship as possible.</p>
<p>
The hostile aliens are Gnomes, Satyrs, Sphinxes and Wolves. The chaotic
aliens are Harpies, Titans and Wyverns.</p>
<h3><a name="Annoying_Aliens"></a>Annoying Aliens</h3>
<p>
The player with the most powerful ship at an alien homeworld may use
the Intimidate Homeworld option to extract money from it, gaining an
amount that depends on the tech level of the aliens, how badly they're
suffering from plague, and how long since they were last hit in this
way. For all types of alien, this will make them become an
enemy of that player. Aliens will also become a player's enemy if the
player is
detected selling contraband to a colony of the race or if he releases a
criminal of that race for a bribe.</p>
<p>
Enemy status can be removed by using the appropriate <a href="#Spells">spell</a>.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Helping_Aliens"></a>
<a name="Cure"></a>
Helping Aliens
</h3>
<p>
Each alien homeworld has a plague level of 0-99%, causing a reduction
in the amount of money available to intimidators and making the aliens
unhappy. Players may use their medical officers and sickbays to fight
plague, gaining favour with the <a href="#Great_Old_Ones">Merciful One</a>.
</p>
<h2><a name="The_Galactic_Council"></a>The Galactic Council</h2>
<p>
There is a loose federal government of the 32 alien races, with minor
powers over them. However, the aliens are a weak willed bunch and none
of them wish to serve in their own government; for that they need the
players.</p>
<p>
The Council consists of a <a href="#President">President</a>, elected
every ten turns, a <a href="#Vice_President">Vice
President</a>, a <a href="#Tribune">Tribune</a>, plus six <a
href="#Ministers">Ministers</a>, appointed by the President as
needed. Only certain players, "candidates", can be elected as President
or appointed as Ministers. Candidates are players who have controlled
at least 10 votes at some time since the previous election.</p>
<p>
Members of the council may receive bonuses to their percentages under
some circumstances, as well as recruiting benefits.</p>
<h3>
<a name="Votes"></a>Votes</h3>
<p>
In theory, the President is elected by the aliens: each homeworld has 6
votes and each colony has 1 vote (32 x 6 + 256 x 1 = 448 in total). In
practice, each homeworld and colony votes the way the player with the
most <a href="#Influence">influence</a> there tells it to vote. So an
election consists of the
players casting the votes they control, if any, for the candidate of
their choice. </p>
<h3><a name="Influence"></a>Influence</h3>
<p>
Each alien race is politically interested in one <a href="#Skills">skill</a>
area,
Engineering, Science, Medical or Weaponry. Officers of that type can
spend a turn campaigning for influence at the homeworld or colony. If
no-one controls the location, or if the player already controls it,
they gain influence equal to the sum of their ship's factors in the
appropriate modules. I.e., a warlike homeworld is impressed by a ship
with good shields and weapons. If the location is already controlled by
another player, then that
player's influence must be removed before the campaigning player can
take control. Influences just cancel out one for one and only the
surplus remains. Influence decays each turn, 10% if the alien race is
an <a href="#Annoying_Aliens">enemy</a> of the
player, 5% if not rounded up.</p>
<h3><a name="President"></a>President</h3>
<p>
The president may appoint Ministers from the candidates (although no
person may
be appointed to more than one ministry). Also the president's crew
serves as her staff. The government picks up
their crew salaries. &nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Vice_President"></a>Vice President</h3>
<p>
The vice president may propose a module of any type or tech level to
the industry minister each turn and he takes over for the president if
the president drops out of the game. The Vice President is the
candidate with the second highest vote total in the presidential
election and traditionally serves as the voice of the opposition. The
Vice President is ineligible to serve as a minister, but he does
receive
an alien report like the ministers.</p>
<h3><a name="Tribune"></a>Tribune</h3>
<p>
The Tribune of the People may propose a module of Primitive or Basic
tech and any type to the industry minister each turn. She is ineligible
to serve as a minister, but she does receive an alien report like the
ministers. The Tribune is elected each turn by captains of ships that
are less than 100 turns old.</p>
<h3><a name="Ministers"></a>Ministers</h3>
<p>
There are six ministers, the Engineering, Science, Medical, Weaponry,
Industry, and Justice ministers.
The Engineering, Science, Medical, and Weaponry ministers each have the
power to propose modules of any tech level and the type they're
responsible for to the Industry Minister. The Industry minister may
direct all shops to restock with modules of a
specific type and tech level from the proposals made by the other
ministers. The Justice Minister may choose the race and skill type of
new rogue
bands, and decides the outcome of court cases between aliens. Each
minister's results includes location reports from various aliens.
Each alien reports to a particular minister, and makes a report during
a random turn once every 30 turns.</p>
<h2><a name="Passwords"></a>Passwords</h2>
<p>
Passwords allow a player to gain various special benefits from the
ancient Starnet Terminals. Passwords are made up of four fragments
each and they are valid for one turn only. Ending the turn in the same
system as a terminal which the player has already accessed will provide
both a password fragment and the option of trying to guess the full
password for the next turn.</p>
<p>
Guessing the wrong password does no harm beyond using up an officer's
action for the turn. Guessing the correct password gains the
appropriate officer one skill level the first time they do it.
Subsequent successes with the same officer gain one of a variety of
special powers. These powers last until the same
power is offered again and then lost. </p>
<h2><a name="Great_Old_Ones"></a>Great Old Ones</h2>
<p>
Four extremely powerful aliens are known to take an interest in events
of the local cluster. Each has a preference for specific types of
activity and will reward players for engaging in that activity. In
particular, each Great One accepts a single player as their <a
href="#Prophets">Prophet</a>,
providing them additional favour related to how many other players also
accept them and follow the ways of that Great One. While they are not
strictly deities, the effect of these beings on normal characters is
much the same as if they were.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Fierce One rewards players for having enemies and for scoring
hits
on enemy ships.</li>
<li>The Wise One rewards players for success at accessing the ancient
computers.</li>
<li>The Merciful One rewards players for healing work and for
fighting plague
amongst the various alien species.</li>
<li>The Mighty One rewards players for having powerful star ships
(excluding weapons and cargo pods, which are not proper engineering)
and lots of energy.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Favour"></a>Favour</h2>
<p>
Favour is the currency of support for a player from the Great Old Ones.
Favour may also be expended at any time to allow officers to carry out
extraordinary actions (known as <a href="#Spells">spells</a>)
depending on great luck and
skill in the Old One's area of interest. It is transferred between
players in several ways. Favour should not be hoarded by most players.
Five percent of favour is lost when
carried over to the next turn, except for Prophets, who suffer decay of
favour in their own field of only 2.5%.</p>
<h2><a name="Spells"></a>Spells</h2>
<p>
The spells and their effects include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Charm Recruit</strong> (of a specific skill type), which
must be used in conjunction
with recruiting from a hiring hall. This spell will attract a
crewperson as
skilled as the recruiting officer, rather than the zero-skill crew
normally recruited from halls.</li>
<li> <strong>Bless</strong> (specific class of module), makes all
the player's modules of
that sort work at 50% higher efficiency for one turn.</li>
<li> <strong>Report from all Terminals</strong> provides the player
with star location
reports from a random selection (based on their science skill level) of
the stars where they've accessed Starnet Terminals and not been purged.</li>
<li> <strong>Report from Some Terminals</strong> provides the player
with a star report from
a random selection (not based on science skill level) of the stars
where she has accessed Starnet Terminals and not been purged. If you've
got a good science officer skill and a lot of
terminals then Report from all Terminals will give you more information.</li>
<li> <strong>Purge Rivals</strong> removes Starnet Terminal access
for all other players to
a terminal in the player's current starsystem.</li>
<li><strong>Improvise Key</strong> (for a specific lock number, 0-7)
must be used in
conjunction with jumping through a stargate locked with the same number
lock. It acts as a single-use key to allow use of an otherwise sealed
stargate.</li>
<li> <strong>Pacify</strong> (a specific enemy alien race) removes
the player's enemy status
with one race, so that their ships no longer attack the player at every
opportunity. It gives no immunity from making an enemy of that race by
annoying them again in the future.</li>
<li> <strong>Uncurse</strong> (of specific type) removes one part of
an artifact's curse on
all artifacts. This will also change the artifact's name, which has no
additional effect.</li>
<li> <strong>Bless Ground Combat</strong> gives a bonus to any kind
of ground combat the
player engages in on the same turn, whether for adventures or catching
criminals.</li>
<li> <strong>Bless Away Team</strong> reduces the chance of
accidents to crew on adventures
when the medical officer is present by giving a bonus to medical skill.</li>
<li> <strong>Enlightenment</strong> (in a specific skill type) gains
the skill of the same
name for the casting officer and may provide clues on various subjects
from the appropriate Great One.</li>
<li><strong>Become Prophet</strong> (of a specific Great One) is only
successful when there
isn't already a Prophet for the specific Great One, or if the casting
player has more favour than the current Prophet and can therefore
displace them. It provides <a href="#Prophets">various benefits</a>
and allows other players to
give or take favour with the spells below. Casting this when there's
already a prophet with more favour in office is taken as a schismatic
attempt to undermine the current prophet and costs them 100 favour too.</li>
<li><strong>Praise Prophet</strong> (of a specific Great One)
provides favour to the
Prophet player.</li>
<li><strong>Denounce Prophet</strong> (of a specific Great One) takes
favour from the
Prophet for the casting player. It is the only spell that yields favour
rather than costing some, though players must have at least 15 favour
to cast the spell anyway. This spell is modified for <a
href="#Prophets">heretics</a>, who pay
favour to cast it instead of gaining favour by it.</li>
<li> <strong>Retire as Prophet</strong> (of a specific Great One),
only available to the
Prophet player, ends their term of being Prophet.</li>
<li> <strong>Trace</strong> (ship in the same starsystem) gives
reports on where the target
ship is each turn, and allows the View Trace spell. Only one ship can
be the target of a player's active Trace spell at a time. Traces are
not detectable<br>
</li>
<li> <strong>View Trace</strong> gives a location report on the star
where the traced ship
is.</li>
<li> <strong>Remove Trace</strong> removes any trace spells which
have been put on the
casting ship.</li>
<li> <strong>Hide System</strong> prevents players not in the star
system where the ship
ends its turn from being able to get reports on that system, by spells,
political office or other means.</li>
<li> <strong>Deploy Probe</strong> places a mechanical device or
live agent at the current
starsystem to report on it later. Each player can have only one probe
active at a time, deploying another removes the first.</li>
<li> <strong>View Probe</strong> gets a report on the system
containing a previously
deployed probe.</li>
<li> <strong>Destroy Probes</strong> removes all other players'
probes in the current
system, if any.</li>
<li> <strong>Micro-jump Flee</strong> attempts to avoid combat by
unprepared and very short
warp jump, with chance of success equal to warp <a href="#Factors">factor</a>.
It
can be cancelled by the counter spell.</li>
<li> <strong>Counter Micro-jump</strong> cancels enemy attempt to
avoid combat with the
micro-jump flee spell.</li>
<li> <strong>Discover Adventure</strong> reveals an adventure at
random, almost always one which will be useful.</li>
<li> <strong>Power-Up</strong> increases ship's rating for <a
href="#Ship_Interactions">power</a> sorting by 25%, so it tends
to meet stronger opponents and have priority on order of actions.</li>
<li> <strong>Power-Down</strong> decreases ship's rating for <a
href="#Ship_Interactions">power</a> sorting by 25%.</li>
<li><strong>Lucky Module</strong>, usable only on a module that's the
only one of its type
in the ship, it makes that module act as tech level 0 for repair and
maintenance that turn and prevents it being targetted in combat. An
officer on standby (and not involved in hunt/hide actions) will
automatically repair or maintain a lucky module (useful for modules
they cannot otherwise repair/maintain).</li>
<li> <strong>Atone</strong> allows you to atone for past misdeeds.
Specifically, some
actions/spells make the Great Old Ones unhappy with you, which can
cause some problems. Casting this spell will make them less unhappy
with you. It can be cast by all of the officers, and is more effective
the more officers that cast it in a given turn. As a hint, most of the
spells/actions that make the Great Old Ones unhappy are not documented
here in the rules. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Prophets"></a>Prophets</h2>
<p>
Each Great Old One may have one player as their Prophet, chosen by the
player themself casting the appropriate Become Prophet spell at a time
when there's not already a Prophet for that Great Old One. Prophets
gain varying amounts of bonus favour directly, and can gain or lose
favour according to other players casting the Praise and Denounce
spells.</p>
<p>
Prophets may designate other players in the same starsystem at the
time as Chosen for their Great Old One. Chosen players may use the
Commune action with the appropriate officer to gain favour equal to
that officer's skill, including crew bonus. Chosen players get a bonus
of +16 in the effective skill and are automatically
"demiblessed" in the two areas governed by the appropriate Great Old
One, e.g. warps and impulses for Mighty chosen. A demiblessing works
like a normal blessing, but only half as much. Demiblessings don't add
to other blessings. Chosen players gain other undocumented benefits too.</p>
<p>
Prophets may remove Chosen status from other players at any time. They
do not need to be in the same star system. Prophets pay favour each
turn
for their Chosen equal to the square of the number of Chosen (counting
the Prophet too). Chosen players may cast any spell in their
field, using their Prophet's favour if they don't have enough of their
own.</p>
<p>
Each turn a Prophet may excommunicate one of the players who denounced
them or tried to replace them on the previous turn. This makes that
player a heretic, which penalises them with a "demicurse" on the
modules
associated with the Prophet's skill area and prevents them from
gaining favour using the denounce spell again. (Instead it costs both
the caster and the prophet 15 favour).</p>
<p>
The Prophet gains favour each turn equal to about 6% of the basic and
adventure favour gains of all players except for Chosen (doubled and
added) and Heretics (subtracted). If a Prophet's own favour score falls
below zero they stop being
Prophet. Prophets are always blessed in the two areas associated with
their
Great Old One, e.g. the Mighty One's Prophet is blessed in warp drives
and impulse drives.</p>
<p>
On any change of Prophet (replacement, retirement of lack of favour
dismissal), all players lose their Chosen and Heretic status in that
field. </p>
<h2><a name="Trade_Goods"></a>Trade Goods</h2>
<p><a href="#Factories">Factories</a> sell trade goods for a fixed
price
and <a href="Rules.html#Colonies">Colonies</a> consumed them, buying
them for a variable price. Each
of the 32 types of good has a basic value of $25 to $500. Factories
sell for the basic value per unit. Each colony only buys one type of
trade good. there are 8 colonies that buy each type of good. The
initial price at all colonies is double the basic value, and a colony
will buy a unit of the good it likes as long as the price is at least
as high as the basic value.</p>
<p>
When a colony buys a trade good, the price there is reduced by 35% of
the basic value, and increased at all other colonies which buy that
type of good by 5% of the basic value. So the average price of each
good remains constant, but demand varies and prices tend to rise where
there are no sellers.</p>
<p>
<a href="#Scrap">Scrap</a> and <a href="#Comet_Clouds">Chocolate</a>
are special trade goods.</p>
<h2><a name="Contraband"></a>Contraband</h2>
<p>
Certain types of trade good (weapons, recreational drugs and dodgy
software) are illegal and indicated by having a (!) in their names.
Selling these risks detection and becoming an <a
href="#Annoying_Aliens">enemy</a> of the colony's government if
detected. There is no direct punishment involved, merely being attacked
by any ships of that race encountered later. </p>
<h2><a name="Popcorn"></a>Popcorn</h2>
<p>
Popcorn is very strange matter/energy, only loosely connected to the
space that it occupies. It can be teleported around the universe easily
and cheaply, so is much in demand for many communications applications.
This also allows for rapid trading so that there is a single price for
Popcorn everywhere on the board. Players can both buy and sell Popcorn
in the Popcorn auction, which occurs at the beginning of the turn.</p>
<p>
For reasons which aren't yet clear, Popcorn can be collected only from
a single unusual place that moves around the cluster, which settles in
near
or deep space locations for a while. It can be detected at long range
(i.e. from a different starsystem) by ships with good enough sensors).
Harvesting popcorn uses impulse
drive, sensor and shield factors. It tends to get harder with each
successful harvesting. </p>
<p>The <strong><a name="LRS">Long Range Scan</a></strong> used 
to detect Popcorn is 
also used to discover stars in your general area.
</p>
<h2><a name="Criminals"></a>Criminals</h2>
<p>
Each <a href="#Locations">location</a> may contain a criminal, defined
by race and rank. Races
include all the standard <a href="#Aliens">aliens</a>
in the game. Ranks are in seven steps
from Heavy to Godparent. Initially no criminals are visible to players.
They must be identified by exploring new locations or by getting a
captive criminal to inform on their comrades.</p>
<p>
Weaponry officers can attempt police work as a standard action in any
location with a visible criminal, as long as they have some <a
href="#Crew">crew</a>. This is an
attempt to capture the visible criminal, with risk of combat and
casualties relating to the criminal's level and the weaponry officer's
skill and crew numbers. Success takes the criminal into the player's
ship as a prisoner. Each player may have only one prisoner at a time.
The previous one escapes to make room if necessary.</p>
<p>
A player with a prisoner has extra options for the weaponry officer -
interrogation and various releases. Interrogation may reveal the
location of the prisoner's boss, a low ranking criminal of
another race, or nothing. After a player learns the
location of a new criminal in this way, they will be able to see that
criminal when in the same star system.</p>
<p>
Releases are either releasing for bribery, which gains cash but makes
the player an enemy of the criminal race's government, or releasing for
information, which identifies the prisoner's boss as if by
interrogation.</p>
<p>
A prisoner may be delivered to a <a href="#Prisons">prison</a>
location for a cash reward.
Criminals who are delivered to prison or are released for bribery or
information immediately escape and/or change identity so that they will
no longer be visible to the player until identified all over again. </p>
<h2><a name="Adventures"></a>Adventures</h2>
<p>
Each star system can have any number of adventures outstanding at any
time, averaging about two. When an adventure is completed successfully
it disappears and another (related but different in detail) adventure
appears at a random place on the board to replace it.</p>
<p>
Each adventure is of a specific <a href="#Skills">skill</a> type
(science, weaponry, medical,
engineering), determining which officer can attempt it, and needs some
level of that skill for success. As well as the officer primarily
concerned with the adventure, any or all of the other three officers
may be assigned to the landing party in support. For any adventure,
there is a 50% chance that each supporting officer will have some
useful effect as hinted at below.</p>
<p>
An adventure has a concealment level, which depends on the skill level
of the adventure. Low-level adventures suitable for newbies will have
concealment levels that are fairly low, while the most difficult
adventures have concealment levels of 300-600 or more. Players can
detect and attempt an adventure if their <a href="#Modules">Sensor</a>
<a href="#Factors">Factor</a> is at least as
high as the adventure's concealment level. An adventure may also be
discovered, regardless of concealment, by <a href="#Exploration">exploring</a>
the location it's
in. Once a player finds an adventure, they will be able to see it
afterwards even if they leave the system and return later.</p>
<p>
Players may also learn of adventures' locations as the result of
success in other adventures This makes the adventure visible to that
player without exploration and regardless of concealment level.
(Informally, a player may also learn the location of an adventure from
another player, but that helps only to guide exploration. The adventure
must still be visible in game turns before the player can attempt it).</p>
<p>
Successful completion of an adventure may need victory in combat with
success much more likely if the weaponry officer joins the away team.
Success gives a skill increase if the officer has not already
succeeded at an adventure of the same sort; It may give a module as
treasure, often in poor condition, better if the engineering officer is
in the
away team. Last, it might reveal some information about where other
adventures
can be found, especially if the science officer is in the away team.
Some crew may be lost to accidents, less likely if the medical officer
is in the away team.Some adventures are of particular interest to a
specific <a href="#Great_Old_Ones">Great Old One</a>,
and success brings extra favour in their area.</p>
<h2><a name="Exploration"></a>Exploration</h2>
<p>
<a href="#Adventures">Adventures</a> and <a href="#Criminals">criminals</a>
are always in specific locations in a star
system, generally the less hospitable ones for adventures and the more
populated ones for criminals. Each turn, a player may explore one such
location in addition to all other actions, and will learn of any
adventures or low ranking ciminals in that location regardless of their
concealment level.</p>
<h2><a name="Alliances"></a>Alliances</h2>
<p>
Although players' major alliances are purely a matter of diplomacy,
there is support within the game system for two-player alliances,
allowing ships to protect their allies in combat. Each ship may have
one other as its ally, selected from the
alliance menu. An
ally can be replaced by a new one, or simply declassified, at any time.
Alliances, in this sense, only have an effect when both ships have
selected the other as their ally and they are in the same star system.
The ships are then treated as a pair for <a href="#Ship_Interactions">interaction</a>
purposes, with the
stronger having an encounter and the weaker meeting no other ship,
i.e. it is protected from any kind of attack. Allies may also give up
to 10% of their current energy to their ally,
when in the same starsystem.</p>
<h2><a name="Ship_Interactions"></a>Ship Interactions</h2>
<p>
Interactions are resolved for each star system in turn, one pair of
ships at a time. To decide which pairs of ships interact, all the ships
in a each star system are sorted by their Power Index, a measure of
their size and technology level. Pairs are then assigned from this
list, i.e. the two most powerful ships interact, the third and fourth
most powerful interact, and so on. If there are an odd number of ships,
then the least powerful will not have an interaction.</p>
<p>The list of interactions is determined at the end of each turn, and
the
interactions occur at the start of the next turn, so orders can be
issued for the specific interaction desired, or feared. An interaction
can include trade, diplomacy and/or combat, according to the players'
orders.</p>
<p>
The orders which control an interaction are diplomatic at the highest
level. Economic and military elements may come into play according to
the result of diplomacy. The diplomatic option is one of the following:
attack
regardless, make demands attack if demands not met, make demands
but don't attack, retaliate if attacked or flee. Retaliate if attacked
and flee both mean don't start a battle if the
other ship doesn't. The difference is that "flee" means start trying to
break off from combat at once even if there's no immediate danger.
Note that all options involve fighting back if attacked. Demands
consist of asking for one module of the other ship. On the
other side, orders can be given to hand over any or all modules if the
other ship demands them. If demands are made and met, the items are
transferred and there is no combat. If demands are made but not met, or
one side orders attack regardless,
<a href="#Combat">combat</a> occurs. Players should set combat orders
even if they don't
expect to have to fight, in case the enemy is unreasonable, though
default orders will apply if none are given.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Combat"></a>Combat</h2>
<p>Because the whole battle is resolved during a turn, with no detailed
instruction from the players on what to do, each ship needs a combat
strategy for how to fight if combat occurs. The strategy consists of
the following set of decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>range at which to open fire</li>
<li>whether to favour engines, weapons, shields, sensors or cloaks</li>
<li>the distribution of shields to protect various parts of the ship</li>
<li>target modules of the enemy ship</li>
<li>rate of fire for photon torpedoes</li>
<li>the number of damaged modules to withstand before retreating</li>
<li>any special hide/hunt actions</li>
</ul>
<p>
All other details of how the ship should fight are derived from these
directions during the battle.</p>
<p>
Hide/Hunt actions affect whether the combat occurs at all as can
certain <a href="#Spells">spells</a>. If either ship selects a hide
option, combat is
cancelled unless the other ship selects a hunt option of equal or
higher risk. The cost of hide/hunt options is that all of the ship's
officers can do nothing else for the turn. The risk is for each
module being damaged. The minimum risk is 1% for any hide/hunt option.</p>
<p>
Combat is fought in a series of rounds (each divided into 7 phases)
each at a specific range. After each round, ships attempt to change or
maintain the range using their Impulse Drives to manoeuvre closer to,
or remain at, their ideal range.
Changing range is somewhat easier at the shorter ranges.</p>
<p>
Initial range is determined by comparing each ship's sensor strength
with the other's cloaking strength, to find the range at which each
detects the other. Sensor and cloaking strengths are calculated as the
proportion of a ship's mass that is sensor/cloaking modules, weighted
by their tech level, plus effective skill levels of science officers
and crews. Sensor conditions in different star systems may allow
detection at different ranges. The sensor conditions are called the
"terrain" of the star system. There are seven different terrains,
corresponding to the seven possible ranges:</p>
<table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="1"
cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="">

<tr>

</table>
<p>
If one ship's cloaks or sensors are better than the others, then the
starting range may be shorter or longer than this. Increasing the range
by one range band requires a 10% advantage in sensors. Increasing the
range requires progressively larger advantages in sensors, going from
+1 range band to +2 requires an additional 20% (for a total advantage
of 30%). Cloaks work similarly. For example, in clear terrain a ship
with sensor factor 10% will see a ship with cloak factor 20% only at
Long range (Distant reduced by 1), but in busy terrain a ship with
sensor factor 40% will detect a ship with cloak factor 10% at Medium
range (Close increased by 2). The cloak/sensor advantages required to
increase the range by a certain amount are summarized below:</p>

<p>
If only one ship is hostile to the other, the other's ideal range is
treated as remote, i.e. the ship that doesn't want to fight will begin
attempting to break off combat as soon as it detects the other ship -
even before the attacker is close enough to open fire.</p>
<p>
If both ships meet conditions for opening fire simultaneously, the tie
is split by favouring the one with larger minimum of its ideal range
and the range at which it detects the other. So one ship always fires
first and it has to be one that is declared hostile to the other.</p>
<p>
Every weapon has a maximum range and it fires during some phases in the
round. The strength of a ship's attack in a given phase is the sum of
all its in-range functional weapons' strengths that fire in that phase,
each weapon doing 5 points of damage per tech level. The whole attack
is applied to one module of the enemy ship, chosen randomly from the
target set in the player's strategy (except that any module that is
both demanded as a gift and included in the target set will be
targetted first). If that set is empty or all hit already, targets are
chosen randomly from the remaining modules.</p>

<p>Photon Torpedoes can attack at any range, but what phases they fire
in
depends on the range. 1-7 at Adjacent, 2-7 at Close, etc. When using
more than 1 torpedo per phase, damage is related to the square root of
the number used, i.e. 4 torpedoes do twice as much damage as 1, and 9
do three times as much as 1.</p>
<p>
Alien ships defending their homeworlds may self-destruct to harm their
opponents, doing damage of 10-70 points (according to range) for each
Primitive module they have left, multiplied by tech level for more
advanced modules. They will delay exploding if they are either giving
more damage than they're taking, or closing the range with a view to
doing more damage when they do blow up.</p>
<p>
All modules have a basic defence capability of 25 points per tech
level, but shield modules increase this basic defence by 360 points per
tech level of the shield. Shield strength is allocated to any number of
modules using the shields menu. Any modules selected for this extra
protection are also defended by having the shield bonus shared between
them. The module's defence is reduced by the enemy attack and,
if reduced to less than zero, the module is hit directly and removed
from the ship. It is then kept aside as loot until after the battle.
Half the
remaining damage points are passed on to the next module to be targeted.</p>
<p>
After each phase, the ship that was attacked is checked for whether the
number of lost modules match or exceed the ship's retreat threshold. A
ship will also try to retreat after losing all its weapons, or at once
if its diplomatic option was Flee. Note that an alien ship defending
its homeworld will self-destruct rather than flee, possibly doing a
great deal of damage to its opponent. Player ships cannot self-destruct.</p>
<p>
A ship attempting to retreat from combat needs a combination of time
(to prepare a micro-jump away) and distance from the enemy ship.
Specifically, it scores "escape" points equal to the range number plus
4 each round, and escapes when it has collected enough (and there is an
additional bonus of escape points to a ship whenever it loses a
module). The number of escape points needed is set by the relative
masses of the ships, and is equal to 50 for ships of the same mass,
with a limit of 10 for a ship fighting a much larger opponent, or 90
for a ship fighting a much smaller opponent. After escape, all lost
modules from both ships become unusable and more damaged. Each ship
gets loot
approximately proportional to the number of modules they shot off
(doubled for the ship that didn't flee). The modules each ship gets
is determined in part by what modules each ship demanded targeted or
shielded. Damage is applied to each lost module in turn, starting as a
small percentage reduction in reliability and increasing for each extra
module on the loot list.</p>
<p>
Combat is further modified by each player's strategy in that they can
"favour" one of weapons, shields, engines, sensors, cloaks or fleeing.
The favoured equipment or activity is 50% more effective then it would
be otherwise. <a href="#Spells">Spells</a> can also increase a ship's
combat effectiveness. </p>
<h2><a name="Movement"></a>Movement</h2>
<p>Movement within a star system is automatic as needed, A ship
can
act at any location in its star system without explicitly needing to
move. Movement out of a star system is always to another star system.
Ships cannot move to squares on the board that do not contain a
detectable star system.</p>
<p>
The cost for a ship to move a given distance is affected by its warp
drives and total
mass. It can move more economically if it has a high proportion of its
mass made
up of warp drives, and even more cheaply if they are high technology
modules. The cost of a jump increases exponentially with the distance
divided by what fraction of the ship is warp drive modules (weighted up
by tech levels) with a bonus for the skill level of the engineering
officer and crew. The starmap included with your turn shows jump costs
to different systems.</p>
<p>
A special type of movement is to "chase" another ship in the same star
system, meaning jump to wherever that ship jumps. It succeeds if the
other ship's destination is one that the chaser can legally jump to.
Chasing is possible where the chased ship is itself chasing another
ship, as long as the chain ends with a ship using normal movement:
mutual chasers don't move. (Remedies for being chased by a stronger
ship include discarding modules until your ship can jump beyond the
hunter's range, or jumping into a group of friends waiting to ambush
the chaser.)</p>
<p>
Movement is also possible via <a href="#Stargates">stargates</a>,
which cost no energy but
needs an <a href="#Artifacts">artifact</a> with the specific type of
key that matches the
stargate being used (there are 8 types of key), or a suitable <a
href="#Spells">spell</a>.
Stargates connect pairs of stars with the distance between them having
no effect.</p>
<p>
A very special case of movement is a free jump to or from "The Holiday
Planet", which is more of an administrative feature to make a ship
inactive while the player is absent from the game. Being at the Holiday
Planet does not completely freeze a ship (but almost), the single big
plus of being there is that no combat is possible. Once there, any
orders submitted by the player will automatically return the ship to
the star from which it originally jumped to the Holiday Planet. Most,
however, will not be executed. </p>
