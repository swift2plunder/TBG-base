<h1>To Boldly Go - A free SF Web Game
</h1>

<p>
The original play test went 15 years and over 2300 turns! It only ended because of a natural disaster.</p>

<h2>
Setting</h2>

<p>
Each player is a new space captain, given an old and failing starship
by mysterious aliens with which to make a name for herself. Local
space is a cluster of a hundred stars or so, containing about fifteen
hundred assorted locations of interest. No other stars are
accessible yet. A typical turn consists of having the four officers do
things. The science officer might go net running in the
old Empire's computers, the weaponry officer may hunt criminals, and
the engineer might raise cash by asteroid mining. A turn can include exploring for hidden
opportunities or possibly a battle with another player or an alien. It
often ends with a jump to a different star for the adventures of the
following turn.</p>

<h2>
Goals</h2>

<p>
TBG is an open-ended game that imposes no goals. Players choose what
they want to achieve and play until they've had enough, or die in the
attempt. There are many routes for advancement in power, knowledge,
wealth and skill, with balancing features to prevent any being "best".
For example, a trader may make large profits by buying and selling
between worlds, if they can beat rivals to the best priced markets and
avoid or buy off the inevitable pirate players. An adventurer may
explore ancient civilizations to find exotic technology and to learn of
leads to new finds, while an empire-builder may work up to intimidate
alien home worlds into paying for "protection."</p>

<h2>
Mechanics</h2>

<p>
Results are put on a web server as soon as each turn runs (Monday,
Wednesday and Friday, at 11pm UTC). The results
contain a form for choosing the next turn's actions, heavily customized
to the player's current position so that only legal actions can be
chosen, mostly selected from menus, i.e. there are no syntax or
keyboard entry errors because there's no keyboard! Having selected all
the actions they want for the next turn, the player clicks the "Make It
So" button and orders are sent to the adjudication program. At the
deadline, all players' orders are combined with other events and new
sets of results mailed out. Here's an <a href="Example.htm" target="_blank">example turn</a>.</p>

<h2>
Subspace Times</h2>

<p>
A <a href="times.html" target="_blank">newsletter</a> is generated each turn from player contributions, plus
mostly true information produced during adjudication. Players also put
a lot of information (or disinformation) on their player pages, stored
on the server and linked from the game results.</p>

<h2>
Cost</h2>

<p>
TBG is run free and ad free by Chris Babcock, who has the time to do so because he lives on disability income. Please feel free to make a donation:</p>

<h2>
To Play</h2>

<p>
First read the <a href="Rules.html" target="_blank">rules.</a> (I'll wait here for you...)</p>

<p>
If you want to join, just use <a href="register_.html" target="_blank">this form</a> and a turn will be emailed to
you when the next turn runs. Don't try to cheat by
starting multiple ships in the names of your cats, spouses, imaginary
friends, etc. They're much easier to spot than people think.</p>

<h2>
Things Not To Do</h2>

<p>
(All these naughtinesses have been done at least once)<br></p>
<ul>
  <li>
Don't sign up without reading the <a href="Rules.html">rules</a> - you'll never get anywhere!</li>
  <li>
Don't ask me for the rules manually - use the form above!</li>
  <li>
Don't sign up without a real name - I'll think you're trying to get a
second ship!</li>
  <li>
Don't use a false reply address - I won't be able to reply to you!</li>
  <li>
Don't sign up without reading the <a href="Rules.html">rules</a> - you'll never get anywhere!
(counts double...)</li>
</ul>

<p>
</p>

<h2>
Utilities for players</h2>

<p>
</p>
<p>Here are <a href="alias.html" target="_blank">forms for sending mail</a> to other players addressed by ship
name, and for having your last set of results or orders sent to you.</p>

<h2>
Free Support Resources
</h2>
<p>Player ships have &quot;flags&quot; with text and, sometimes, 
pictures. While the capability of adding images to flags is temporarily 
broken, players who want to get ahead of things may want to create 
their image flags now. A variety of free services are available to 
help. Both <a href="http://pizap.com/">Pizap</a> (online) and GIMP 
(a free program) - available for both 
<a href="http://www.gimp.org/downloads/">Linux</a> and 
<a href="http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/">Windows</a> - are good 
for making GIFs while <a href="http://imageshack.us/">Imageshack</a> 
is as good place as any to host images. The annoyance of the adverts
is somewhat offset by the availability of a developer API, which 
we are currently planning to use for image uploading and gallery 
management for the aforementioned flags.</p>

<p>
For any problems which can't be solved by reading the web pages and
filling in online forms, email <a href="mailto:tbg-moderator@asciiking.com">Chris Babcock</a>.</p>
