<h3>
There is no privacy. Here&#39;s why:
</h3>
<p>
The information collected for your ASCII King account comes from Facebook. It is information that you have already volunteered to make public. ASCII King Games is not selling your data or
using it to sell advertising. It is only used to improve your playing experience by reducing duplicate positions in games played on ASCII King and to provide social media features.
</p>
<p>
While we do our best to protect your privacy, including hashing your passwords, there are certain times in certain games that email addresses and game passwords are transmitted in the clear and/or logged. The hosting company, iWeb, maintains a back door into the system for customer service, so it&#39;s theoretically possible that any employee could access your data.
</p>
<h3>
What personal information is collected?
</h3>
<p>
The following Personally Identifiable Information may be collected or created as part of your user registration on ASCII
King Games:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
User ID: The registration process creates a local user ID. This number is used by the server to maintain access histories even when a player changes his email address or user name. Additionally, individual games may create their own user IDs.
</li>
<li>
Name: First and last name are required in nearly all situations. If you have a widely known alias or some security reason to avoid using your real and complete name, please contact the admin directly. ASCII King Games promotes a &quot;real name culture&quot; rather than one based on a pseudonym or otherwise partially anonymous. This makes games better because people are more likely to behave well when they don&#39;t have an expectation
of anonymity.
</li>
<li>
Phone: A phone number is only collect if it is public on Facebook or if you freely provide it at registration. It provides additional evidence that you are a real person. It is used for the purpose of clearing you if you are falsely accuse of cheating. If you do not want to provide your phone number to ASCII King Games, simply write "Not Supplied" in that registration field.
</li>
<li>
Site: This is a text description of where your computer &quot;lives&quot; on the Internet. Sometimes supplied by the user, this description may be obtained from a look up of your IP Address, from Facebook or from some other location service.
</li>
<li>
Address: Please do NOT supply a street address. We only want the city and other geo-political boundary information (state, province, etc.) that we need to uniquely identify the location of
the player in the real world.
</li>
<li>
Email: The games on ASCII King are play by email games or otherwise depend on email for communication that is a vital part of the game. You must supply an email address that will be reachable by the server, the administrator and the moderator of any games you play.
</li>
<li>
IPaddress: The location of your computer in cyberspace. This number may be obtained from the headers of your email to the server or from web pages and links to ASCII King domains supplied in newsletters.
</li>
<li>
Facebook ID, Twitter ID and user names from other social media outlets: Certain games on ASCII King will follow you on Twitter if you supply your Twitter ID and other enhancements to the player experience
using social media are planned.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
How does the administrator use this information?
</h3>
<p>
It is the policy of the administrator not to use registration information for any other purpose than maintaining the quality of play on this server. Specifically:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Personally identifiable information is used to control duplicate registrations on the server. Deliberate duplications are grounds for permanent ban, which may also be enforced by other admins.
</li>
<li>
Geographic information is used to prevent players who have a high probability of knowing each other from playing in the same game, when such is not allowed. Also some games hosted on ASCII
King may also be played face to face. Location information may be used to help players to find other players with similar interests nearby.
</li>
<li>
When a phone number is provided then the admin may call to reply to a question if there is reason to believe that email will not be received.
</li>
<li>
Email is used exclusively for game related topics of the type and frequency described below.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
How often will I be contacted?
</h3>
<p>
The admin may contact any registered player by email at any time about conduct on the server or about other game related topics with a reasonable frequency. Email you may expect to see as a consequence of playing in ASCII King games includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Mail from the server about the progress of your game. Headers and footers in these mails may contain messages about the status of the server, including finances, appeals for donations and links to matters of interest in the hobby.
</li>
<li>
Mail from the administrator ex officio as admin concerning matters of conduct on the server and clarification of personally identifying information needed to ensure quality play.
</li>
<li>
Mail from the admin in capacity as game moderator inviting you to participate in games.
</li>
<li>
Newsletters from the admin for registered members, active members or donors.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
What if I don&#39;t want to
receive mail from the server or the administrator?
</h3>
<p>
If, at any time, you want to be removed from the registration database then you must contact the administrator in order to be manually removed. In order to keep removal requests to a minimum, it is the policy of the admin to make all removals total and permanent. If you abandon any games due to the removal then other admins may be notified as well. Moreover, removal from the registration database will not remove archived information from other sites (applies mostly to Diplomacy games).
</p>
<p>
There will be an unsubscription mechanism available shortly.
</p>
<h3>
What is done to protect the privacy of minors?
</h3>
<p>
Children under the
age of 13 are not permitted on ASCII King games without the 
permission of their parents and certain games are not available 
to minors because they publish personal data or deploy unmonitored 
communication services. In Diplomacy, for example, it is not 
possible to moderate all press in public games, but minors are 
invited to 
<a href="http://zaed.asciiking.com/">play Diplomacy on ZAED</a>. 
Minors under the age of 13 will not be allowed to play To Boldly Go until 
<a href="http://tickets.asciiking.com/show_bug.cgi?id=69">Bug 69</a> 
is resolved.
